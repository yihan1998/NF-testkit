flexio_rpc
==========

This is a sample application for executing Flex IO with a remote process call.

The device program calculates the sum of 2 input parameters, prints the result,
and copies the result back to the host application.

This sample demonstrates how applications are built (DPA and host), how to create
processes and message streams, how to open the IBV device, and how to use RPC
from the host to DPA function

Compilation
-----------
perform
$ ./build.sh
from root of samples

Results are:
<sample root>/build/flexio_rpc/host/flexio_rpc

Execution
-----------
Usage: <sample root>/build/flexio_rpc/host/flexio_rpc <mlx5 device> <arg1> <arg2>
There:
  mlx5 device - IBV device with DPA
  arg1 - first numeric argument
  arg2 - second numeric argument

For example:
$ cd <sample root>
$ ./build/flexio_rpc/host/flexio_rpc mlx5_0 44 55
Welcome to 'Flex IO RPC' sample
Registered on device mlx5_0
/  2/Calculate: 44 + 55 = 99
Result: 99
Flex IO RPC sample is done
